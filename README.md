Take home Test from Justin

It is a very simple dApp using Rinkeby Ethereum network to running the application.

Name.sol file was created by Remix, ABI and contract file were used in index.html file.
There are mainly 2 methods: getName & setName

index.html file was created by javascript and HTML tag.
User can login with metamask account and change the stored name value by enter a new name in text box.
It will cost some gas fee and take a few second to update the value.

Finally, you can click the "get Name" button and it will prompt the message box to show the updated name inside the contract.
